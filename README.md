# The Modern Data Culture

Promoting modern data culture is all about visibility. 
It's hard to care about individual data entries.
Everyone has an innate feeling for what data is "right" vs "wrong".
All you need to do is show people the data.

Data entry is closest to the data source and should be able to define and see the data they enter.
Data Catalog - Source
- Closest to what they know
- See ranges or aggregates of what is entered as a whole
- Examples, not everything, for data security
- See definitions alongside actual data
- Be able to suggest changes to definitions right there.
- Visibility into tests? Multiple layers, the data application layer vs pipeline tests

Data entry should also know how their data is being used downstream.
Data Catalog - BI
- Can see how their data entry is defined downstream
- Can see how their data entry affects metrics, what is counted what is not counted?
- Can suggest changes to definitions based on perception vs reality of data entered.

Power data entry users can gradually gain access to more of the data pipeline (staging, warehouse, BI)
- Don't want to overwhelm up front
- More questions and suggestions should unlock deeper understanding

Business users should know how data is being entered and how it becomes available to them for decisions.
